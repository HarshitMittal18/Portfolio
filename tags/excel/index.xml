      <description>Data are just summaries of thousand of stories and in this project I have leveraged this power of data to communicate a Data Story about a Superstore located in USA. The story I choose revolves around 4 Sales Personal namely Anna Andreadi, Cassandra Brandow, Chuck Magee and Kelly Williams that work in the Superstore in four different regions namely West, South, East and Central repectively. I have tried to analyse the sales performance of these 4 sales personal and in doing so I have used Excel so as to create a powerful Data Story.</description>
